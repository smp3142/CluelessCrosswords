    <h2 id="what-is-a-clueless-crossword-puzzle">What is a clueless crossword puzzle?</h2>
    <p>A clueless crossword can be thought of as a cross between a normal crossword puzzle and a cryptogram. The board
      is
      the normal grid of white and black squares, and the white squares need to filled in with letters to make words.
      All
      words, both horizontal and vertical, need to be valid words. Rather than having a list of clues for the words
      though, the crossword board is filled in with numbers that represent letters. Each letter corresponds to only one
      number. A few letters will be prefilled in to give a starting point. An example of a starting board is below.</p>

    <h2 id="what-is-this-application">What is this application?</h2>
    <p>This application makes printable clueless crossword puzzles in PDF format. Though they are meant to be printed,
      the
      PDF files do work well with tablets that allow handwriting such as an iPad or Surface.</p>
    <p>The options for the pdf are: - The number of puzzles per pdf (1 - 20) - The page size (letter or A4) - Puzzle
      font
      size (2 puzzles in portrait, or 1 large print puzzle in landscape) - The minimum percentage of blank tiles in the
      puzzle to be prefilled (15% - 50%) - Option to print the list of 2 and 3 letter words used to make the puzzles</p>
    <h2 id="how-do-you-play">How do you play?</h2>
    <p>The board consists of three grids. The large grid in the middle is the puzzle itself. The small grid on the left
      is
      for the player to keep track of which number corresponds to which letter. The small grid on the right is used to
      cross off letters after they are used to avoid using a letter more than once.</p>
    <p>There are several different ways to approach solving a puzzle. The best place to start is to find a two or three
      letter word that is partially filled in, and that has only one possible way to complete it.</p>
    <p>For example, the words circled in orange below could be useful places to start, but they have too many possible
      options. There are six possible two letter words that start with “O” for example. One of which is OX, but as the X
      is already used, it can be ignored. This still leaves 5 options however, so it is best to try somewhere else.</p>
    <p>The next place to look is the two words circled in purple. There are two common words that are three letters long
      and end in “GO”. They are “EGO” and “AGO”, which means the number 17 corresponds to either “A” or “E”. However,
      the
      six letter word ends in the number 17, and has an “X” in the second last spot. There are no words that end in
      “XA”,
      but there are several that end in “XE”. Thus, the number 17 corresponds to “E”</p>

      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Preparing to start solving the puzzle</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Once you have identified a letter, simply fill in every spot that has the number with the letter, then cross it
      off
      on the right hand grid. This process is repeated until the puzzle is complete.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./03.png" alt="Starting to solve the puzzle" />
      <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Starting to solve the puzzle</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>If there are no spots that have only a single option, then the next step could be to make an educated guess. Ways
      to improve your guess include:
    <ul>
      <li>Checking that it results in valid English. Guessing that 12 is “B” results in “BEE” which is a valid word for
        example. </li>
      <li>Guessing that 12 is “L” results in “LEE” which is valid, but “L” is already used as 03. </li>
      <li>Guessing that 12 is “J” results in “JEE” which isn’t a valid word. </li>
      <li>The guess can be narrowed down using the rules of the English language. For example, 12 appears at the end of
        several words, therefore it is more likely to be an “S” or “D” rather than an “A” or “Z”. </li>
      <li>It is also worth remembering that some letters are far more common than others. “E” is extremely common, while
        “J” is very rare for example. </li>
      <li>A common source of difficulty is accidentally using the same letter twice. Always ensuring that you cross off
        the used letters on the grid on the right helps solve this issue.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
    <p>Not every letter is used in every puzzle, therefore there could be a couple of unused numbers. Generally, each
      puzzle has between 0 and 2 unused letters.</p>
    <p>Over 19,000 words are used in the list used in this app. It includes some uncommon or informal words, though an
      effort was made to exclude extremely rare words, uncommon jargon, and most generally offensive words. Please
      create
      an issue letting me know if any words should be considered for addition or removal.</p>
    <p>Some words that are valid English and may appear in other word games may not be in the list used to build this
      app.
      Two and three letter words are of particular note, so there is an option that can be used to print these words
      when
      making a puzzle.</p>
    <p>The algorithm used to build the boards is primarily based on randomness. This means that it may make boards that
      have a surprising variety in difficulty. It can be adjusted to a decent extent by changing the number of hints and
      the percentage of the board that is prefilled if desired.</p>
    <p>The random nature of making the boards also results in some variation in terms of the time it takes to make each
      puzzle. Generally, it should take 1 or 2 seconds, but occasionally it may take as long as 7 to 10 seconds.</p>
